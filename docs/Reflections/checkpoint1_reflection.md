# Checkpoint 1 Reflection

## What I Implemented

I implemented:

- Input Handling: The player's key presses are captured (without printing to the console) and are mapped to game actions.
- Menu Navigation: Players can navigate the main menu and select options using the keyboard. They can also do this in sub-menus like the difficulty selection screen. W, S, Up Arrow, and Down Arrow keys can be used to move the selection cursor, and Enter, E, or Space select the highlighted option.
- Color Namespace: A Color namespace that contains ANSI escape codes for coloring and styling the console text. This is used to make the console output more visually appealing.

## Challenges I Faced

No challenges were faced during this checkpoint. Implementation was straightforward since I had already coded a input handling system in the console rpg project.

## What I Learned

N/A

## Testing Results

This checkpoint did not require any automated tests, as input handling and menu navigation are best tested manually. I simply ran the program and printed out the captured key presses to make sure they were correctly mapped to game actions. I also manually navigated through the menus to make sure that the selection cursor moved as expected and that options could be selected properly.
